A very crude Blender plugin that can import/export tmd models from PSX games. Should work with non-gradated flat and gouraud tris and quads. 
Tested only with gouraud textured tris in X-Men: MA.

There is a side-panel to view/change face flags when in face edit mode. Receiving info breaks from time to time, but setting doesn't, you can open spreadsheet to visualize.
Flags are stored as custom attributes per face.

Has normal table issues I wasn't able to solve. Won't probably arise with character models, but might cause issues with levels.

Provided as is.

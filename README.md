Consolidated X-Men Mutant Apocalypse (PSX) Toolkit.

+ WAD Tool can unpack and repack large WAD archives.
+ DOT Tool can unpack and repack inner DOT archives.
+ TMD Viewer can preview TMD models with TMD_POS (default position), TIMs (textures) and TMD_ANM (animations). 
+ BlenderPSXTMDPlugin is a very crude Blender plugin that can import/export tmd models from PSX games. Should work with non-gradated flat and gouraud tris and quads. 

Provided as is.

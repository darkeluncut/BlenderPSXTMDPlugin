A very crude Blender plugin that can import/export tmd models from PSX games. Should work with non-gradated flat and gouraud tris and quads. 
Tested only with gouraud textured tris.

There is a side-panel to view/change face flags when in face edit mode. Receiving info breaks from time to time, but setting doesn't, you can open spreadsheet to visualize.

Provided as is.
